## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
a <- c(2, 3, 5)
b <- c(4,-1, 3)
```

```{r}
a %% b

c(2%%4, 3%%(-1), 5%%3)

a ** b
```

```{r}
sequenceNums <- c(11, 6, 8, 11, 12, 11, 3, 7, 10, 8)
print(sequenceNums)

sequenceNums %% 2 
```

```{r}
c(2+4, 3+(-1), 5+3)
c(2**4, 3**(-1), 5**3)

# 狀況一: 堆疊一定倍數剛好一樣長
c(2,3)/c(-2,-13,10,22)
c(2,3,2,3)/c(-2,-13,10,22)


# 狀況二: 倍數堆疊一定會超過，只好截斷
c(2,3)/c(-2,-13,10)
c(2,3,2)/c(-2,-13,10)


```

```{r}
